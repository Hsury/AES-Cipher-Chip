default_max_transition value
----------------------------
The default_max_transition time for this library has been set to coincide with
the maximum transition time for which the library has been characterized. For
most designs, the default_max_transition will be too high, so it should be
adjusted, using the set_max_transition command in Synopsys, to a more
appropriate value specific to the target design.

Wireload models
---------------
The wireload tables included within these timing models are FOR REFERENCE
ONLY. Wireload models are very subjective to variations due to place & route
design style, place & route tools, number of metal layers, block size, routing
density and other design specific parameters. It is strongly recommended that
users develop their own wireload models for their specific design environment
for the highest level of accuracy.

Process K-factors
-----------------
For each Synopsys library (fast, typical, slow), both the "nom_process"
variable and the "process" operating condition are set to 1. Because each
corner library was characterized using the foundry's corresponding process
models (FF for fast, TT for typical, SS for slow), it is not necessary to
derate the process condition within Synopsys. When mixing Artisan libraries
with other vendor libraries, the Artisan process operating condition should be
set equal to the nom_process value to maintain timing accuracy.

Transition Time Measurements
----------------------------
Transition time measurements are made from 30% of VDD to 70% of VDD for rising
signal transitions. Transition time measurements are made from 70% of VDD to
30% of VDD for falling signal transitions. Transition times are extrapolated
to 10% and 90% threshold values in timing models, such as the .lib to remain
compatible with IP from other vendors.

"dont_use" Properties
---------------------
The following cells have the "dont_use" property set by default:

  RF1R1WX1 RF2R1WX1 RFRDX1 RFRDX2 RFRDX4 TIEHI TIELO

The RF* cells are designed for building custom register file instances, which
cannot by synthesized by DesignCompiler. The RF* cells must be instantiated by
hand or by hand-crafted script to build custom register file instances.

The TIE* cells have the dont_use property set due to widespread customer
requests that prefer to tie off signals directly to the VDD and VSS rails. If
you prefer to tie off pins using the TIEHI/TIELO cells, you should disable the
"dont_use" properties on TIEHI/TIELO cells in the Synopsys libraries.
